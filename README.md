üìù Project Description: Online Bookstore
This project is a Java-based web application that simulates an online bookstore platform where users can browse, search, and purchase books.

It supports user account management, including registration, login, and order history viewing.

Customers can add books to a shopping cart, view the total price, and place orders through a simplified checkout process.

An admin module is included, allowing administrators to manage books (add, update, delete) and oversee customer orders.

The application follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, separating business logic, UI, and data access layers.

It is built using Java EE technologies like Servlets and JSP, with Apache Tomcat as the web server.

Maven is used for dependency management and project building.

Frontend components are created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and dynamic content is handled using JSP.

The project includes a dummy dataset for testing purposes, but can be extended to use real relational databases like MySQL.

Developed and tested using Eclipse IDE, this project serves as a complete full-stack Java web development example.

It is ideal for learning how to build and structure e-commerce-style applications with proper separation of concerns.
